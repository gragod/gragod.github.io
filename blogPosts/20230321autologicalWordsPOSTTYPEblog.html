              Many times in the past I have heard some word and noticed that it could, in some way,
              be said to describe <em>itself</em>. I never really had a precise way of describing or
              putting a name to this phenomenon until today when I looked up "words that describe
              themselves" in google and came across what I was looking for on the wikipedia page for
              the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grelling%E2%80%93Nelson_paradox">
              Grelling–Nelson paradox</a> which mentioned <a target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word">autological words</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, when I would think about this over the last couple years the perenial example
              I would always go back to was synonym. I would say synonym was a synonym of synonym so
              it describes itself, although actually a synonym of a word has to be a different word
              so that doesn't really make sense. But then I would also think of antonym which is a
              real autological word which describes itself because of course it is the antonym of
              the word synonym.

              I found a big <a target="_blank" href="http://www.segerman.org/autological.html">list</a>
              of autological words by Henry Segerman but I believe there are some I've thought of in
              the past which are not there. I should create a list of them somewhere sometime. He
              talks about the Grelling-Nelson paradox there as well. Basically its about whether
              heterological (meaning a word that doesn't describe itself) describes itself which
              results in a paradox.

              Which is good! Because as we all know, paradoxes are contradictions, and contraditions
              are fun!
