              I recently got into chess and was inspired to create my own chess website!
              I am having to relearn a bit of how to make websites so that should be Fun.
              I also feel like there should be a more elegant way to create posts for this blog.
              Probably utilizing a database for posts would be good?
              Or a seperate file?
