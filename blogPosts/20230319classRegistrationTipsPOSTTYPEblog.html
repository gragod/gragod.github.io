                Complete the pre-registration steps, (you won't want to be caught at the last
                minute having to rush through these)
              </li>

                When you want to add a class to myplan, always check the enrollment restrictions
                by clicking on the enrollment restrictions tag or view more details, classes will
                often have requirements based on major or class standing and if you don't meet
                those requirements your <em>entire</em> registration will be denied, potentialy
                losing you out on a spot in another class and you'll have to remove this class
                anyway.

                Make sure you know what day you are registering for and that you set an alarm for
                something like fifteen minutes before 6am, you don't want to let some unforseen
                problem or slow boot up to make you miss registration if you wake up too close to
                6am.
              </li>
              <li>
                As 6am approaches hover your mouse over the send to registration button and click it
                1 to 2 seconds before 6 am actually arrives. Set up a clock with the time up to the
                second so you can see this. Even though you are clicking send before 6am it will
                still accept it in my experience, and classes are first come first served so getting
                in even a moment earlier might make the difference for you.

                Be ready to register with sln as a backup. When the traffic is really high with
                everyone trying to register all at the same moment, sometimes the whole site has
                been brought to a standstill with people unable to register while stuck on frozen or
                loading pages. Registering with sln can sometimes get around this slowdown and save
                you from the UW's apparently awful prepardness for the flood of 6am registrations
                that they mandated.
