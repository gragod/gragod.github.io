              I recently got into chess and was inspired to create my own chess website!
              I am having to relearn a bit of how to make websites so that should be Fun.
              I also feel like there should be a more elegant way to create posts for this blog.
              Probably utilizing a database for posts would be good?
              Or a seperate file?

              <h2>Autological words</h2>

              Many times in the past I have heard some word and noticed that it could, in some way,
              be said to describe <em>itself</em>. I never really had a precise way of describing or
              putting a name to this phenomenon until today when I looked up "words that describe
              themselves" in google and came across what I was looking for on the wikipedia page for
              the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grelling%E2%80%93Nelson_paradox">
              Grellingâ€“Nelson paradox</a> which mentioned <a target="_blank"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word">autological words</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, when I would think about this over the last couple years the perenial example
              I would always go back to was synonym. I would say synonym was a synonym of synonym so
              it describes itself, although actually a synonym of a word has to be a different word
              so that doesn't really make sense. But then I would also think of antonym which is a
              real autological word which describes itself because of course it is the antonym of
              the word synonym.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found a big <a target="_blank" href="http://www.segerman.org/autological.html">list</a>
              of autological words by Henry Segerman but I believe there are some I've thought of in
              the past which are not there. I should create a list of them somewhere sometime. He
              talks about the Grelling-Nelson paradox there as well. Basically its about whether
              heterological (meaning a word that doesn't describe itself) describes itself which
              results in a paradox.
            </p>
            <p>
              Which is good! Because as we all know, paradoxes are contradictions, and contraditions
              are fun!

              <h2>Class Registration Tips</h2>
            </header>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Complete the pre-registration steps, (you won't want to be caught at the last
                minute having to rush through these)
              </li>
              <li>
                When you want to add a class to myplan, always check the enrollment restrictions
                by clicking on the enrollment restrictions tag or view more details, classes will
                often have requirements based on major or class standing and if you don't meet
                those requirements your <em>entire</em> registration will be denied, potentialy
                losing you out on a spot in another class and you'll have to remove this class
                anyway.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure you know what day you are registering for and that you set an alarm for
                something like fifteen minutes before 6am, you don't want to let some unforseen
                problem or slow boot up to make you miss registration if you wake up too close to
                6am.
              </li>
              <li>
                As 6am approaches hover your mouse over the send to registration button and click it
                1 to 2 seconds before 6 am actually arrives. Set up a clock with the time up to the
                second so you can see this. Even though you are clicking send before 6am it will
                still accept it in my experience, and classes are first come first served so getting
                in even a moment earlier might make the difference for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be ready to register with sln as a backup. When the traffic is really high with
                everyone trying to register all at the same moment, sometimes the whole site has
                been brought to a standstill with people unable to register while stuck on frozen or
                loading pages. Registering with sln can sometimes get around this slowdown and save
                you from the UW's apparently awful prepardness for the flood of 6am registrations
                that they mandated.
